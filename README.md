# Movie-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis-with-BERT
This is the implementation of the Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis journal version paper. There are four versions of the code but all are typically doing the same thing the difference is just on classification scales and computation of overall polarity from  output vector depending on the number of classes. 

Need to install keras, tensorflow, transformers, pandas, pytorch and pretrained bert.

Training and testing are done in same file depending on the classification task. We dont include all datasets in the the code, so to use other datasets see Utilities.py code. Run the files by supplying the follwing command:

_python filename_.
